# PLM Project

## Background

Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement - a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available from the website here: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset). 
   
   
## Executive Summary

The objective of this project is to build a Machine Learning Model that predicts the 'classe' of excercises that an individual followed, based on their captured activity quality from their individual monitors. The "classe" variable is one provided in the training set to help train the Model. We use any of the other variables to predict with. This report describes how we built this Model, how we used cross validation, what we think the expected out of sample error is, and why the basis on which we made the choices to build it. As a proof of suucessful prediction, we will also use the same prediction model to predict 20 different test cases.
